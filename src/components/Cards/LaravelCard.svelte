    I learned it in university, and I worked on some freelance projects with it.
</p>
<p>
    Usually I use it for do API's and then connect it to a front-end but I also
    know build it with MVC with frontend and backend all in laravel
</p>
<p>
    Also I have experience with laravel compliments like Sanctum, laravel
    Passport and Telescope
