  I learned it in Jan 2022. I started with it at personal projects and then I
  started to have some professional projects
</p>
<p>
  Where I had more experience with React was at Lexir Inc where I worked for 6
  months as a freelance front-end developer
</p>
<p>
  I am worked there with NextJs and Typescript as a javasript framework and with
  Tailwind as a Css Library

<style lang="scss">
  p {
    margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
    font-family: $varela;
    font-size: 16px;
    font-weight: lighter;
    line-height: 1.5;
    color: white;
  }
  ul {
    list-style: outside;
    font-weight: lighter;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
