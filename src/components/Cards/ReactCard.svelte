    I'm still learning it online at platzi.com, reading the official documentation, and practicing each concept by myself.
</p>
<p>I didn't have professional experience with it yet, but I'm working on personal projects to learn better.</p>
<p>Soon I will be uploading my personal projects in a new tab on this page</p>

<ul>
    <li>Soon</li>
</ul>

<style lang="scss">
    p {
        margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
        font-family: $varela;
        font-size: 16px;
        font-weight: lighter;
        line-height: 1.5;
        color: white;
    }
    ul {
        list-style: outside;
        font-weight: lighter;
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    li {
        font-family: $varela;
        margin: 0.5rem 0;
    }
    a {
        margin: 2rem 1rem;
        color: white;
        font-weight: lighter;
        font-size: 16px;
    }
</style>
